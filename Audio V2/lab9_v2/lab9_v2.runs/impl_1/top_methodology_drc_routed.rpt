2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on audio_sounds[0] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on audio_sounds[1] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on audio_sounds[2] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on audio_sounds[3] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on AUD_PWM relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>
